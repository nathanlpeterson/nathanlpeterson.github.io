    This is a Power BI demo - Input is 3 columns for each second: Case (Device), TimeStamp, On/Off.<br>

    Attributes:<br>
    Device: Type of device used.<br>
    Case: A particular instance of a device - used by one particular patient. A Case is a combination of patient / device.<br>
    Event: An occurence of a particular device being On or Off.<br>
    Patient: Person who uses device.<br>

    Measures:<br>
    % Time On: Number of Seconds the device(s) were on divided by the Total Number of Seconds within context.<br>
    Avg Seconds Per Event: Number of Seconds the device(s) were on divided by the Number of Times the devices were switched on.<br>
    Number of Times On: Count of times devices were switched on.<br>
    Total Seconds On: Number of Seconds the device(s) were on.<br>

    Getting Around:<br>
    The lower left-hand corner of each page contains a Bookmark and Filter button. When clicked, these reveal their associated ribbon. Click the Left button to hide the ribbon.<br>

    Notes on the Sample Data:<br>
    Populated a row for each second of a single 24 hour period for each of 10 devices, with randomized On/Off. One drawback is that the Measures are Highly Correlated.<br> 
    Because of this, it is difficult to demonstrate visualizing how multiple variables work with each other.<br>
